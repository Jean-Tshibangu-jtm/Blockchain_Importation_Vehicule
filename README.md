# Blockchain_Importation_Vehicule

Nowadays, blockchain is applied in several fields, notably that of cryptocurrency (finance), and several results have been approved by their relevance and can also serve as a starting point. Our motivation is to apply this technology to the vehicle import system in Africa.
The project consists of setting up a solution for the import and export of vehicles with blockchain technology, by bringing together all the participants (Banks, Exporter, Importer, Insurer, etc ...) for a trust between party and a security.
